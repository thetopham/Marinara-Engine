# Conversation Mode — Getting Started

Conversation Mode is one of Marinara Engine's chat modes, alongside Roleplay, Visual Novel, and Game. Where Game Mode runs a structured RPG and Roleplay drops you into an immersive scene with sprites and backgrounds, **Conversation is Discord-style DMs** — one or more characters, an input bar, and a message history. No GM, no scene chrome, no required mechanics. It's the lightest-weight mode and the one most users will spend the most time in.

This guide is a getting-started reference. It covers what Conversation Mode does, how to set up a chat, the difference between 1:1 and group chats, the Conversation-specific features (schedules, autonomous messages, character exchanges, audio calls, reactions, table games, selfies), how connected chats work, and what models and parameters tend to fit well.

**What this guide does not cover:** deep agent customization, regex scripts, branching/swipe internals (those work the same across modes), and the lorebook authoring UI itself. See [Agent System](AGENT_SYSTEM.md) and [Regex Scripts](REGEX_SCRIPTS.md) for those power-user systems.

## When to pick Conversation Mode

Use Conversation Mode when:

- You want to chat with a character the way you'd DM a friend — text in, text out, no scene state.
- You want to talk to **multiple characters at once** in one thread (group chats are part of Conversation Mode, not their own mode).
- You're on a **free or weaker connection** that struggles with structured-JSON outputs. Conversation is forgiving — most models that can chat at all can run a conversation.
- You want **autonomous behavior** — characters that send messages on their own, follow availability schedules, and react across time.

Pick Roleplay or Game Mode instead if you want immersive scene presentation (sprites, backgrounds), or structured RPG mechanics (party, quests, combat, world state).

## Setting up a chat

When you start a new Conversation chat, a four-step setup wizard appears. You can also dismiss it and configure later via the chat settings drawer.

The wizard steps are:

- **Name & Connection** — name the chat, choose the LLM connection, and optionally enable **Customize Parameters**.
- **Prompt Preset** — choose the Conversation prompt preset or enable a custom Conversation prompt override.
- **Persona & Characters** — pick your persona and one or more characters. One character creates a private DM; multiple characters create a group chat.
- **Automation** — configure autonomous messages, schedules, calls, and the **Commands** grid.

Automation defaults: Autonomous Messages is on, Generate Schedules is off, Audio/Video Calls is off, and Commands is on. The Commands grid controls which command families characters may use, including Schedule Updates, Cross-Post, Selfies, Memories, Scenes, Music, Haptics, Influence, Notes, Calls, Reactions, UNO, and Chess.

Once Connection and at least one Character are set, click **Start chatting** to apply the settings and enter the chat. Lorebooks are attached later via the chat settings drawer; the Conversation prompt is chosen in the wizard's Prompt Preset step.

## Single-character vs. group chats

The number of characters you select determines the chat shape:

- **1 character** — a 1:1 DM. The character responds to each of your messages.
- **2 or more characters** — a group chat. By default, the chat model produces one merged reply and decides which characters naturally chime in. `@mentions` focus specific characters, and characters marked offline by their schedule sit out. You can also tell characters to stay quiet unless you mention or manually trigger them — see [Group chat configuration](#group-chat-configuration) below.

There's no separate "group chat mode" to enable — the engine flips into group behavior automatically when you have more than one character.

## Group chat configuration

A few settings in the chat settings drawer shape how group chats behave. (Roleplay and Game Mode have their own, more elaborate group-chat controls — what's described here is Conversation-specific.)

### Reply When Mentioned

A single toggle in the chat settings drawer.

- **OFF** (default) — characters reply automatically to your messages. If you `@mention` a specific character, the response focuses on that character.
- **ON** — characters stay quiet until you `@mention` one or trigger one from the **character picker** that appears in the input bar (visible in group chats). Useful when you want tight control over turn-taking and don't want everyone responding to every message.

### Character exchanges

A toggle in the chat settings drawer (visible only when you have multiple characters) that lets characters chat with **each other** rather than only with you. Character exchanges are driven by the autonomous messaging system while you are idle, weighted by character talkativeness and schedule availability.

## Impersonating your persona

Use `/impersonate [direction]` when you want Marinara to draft a message as **you** instead of as a character. The model reads your selected persona, recent chat context, and the optional direction text, then writes a user-side reply you can keep, edit, or swipe like other generated text.

The chat settings drawer has an **Impersonate** section with global defaults for this workflow:

- **Prompt Template** — overrides the built-in impersonation instruction. Leave it empty to use the chat-specific prompt, or the built-in default if the chat has none.
- **Preset** — optionally route roleplay-style impersonation through a specific prompt preset. Conversation Mode falls back to the chat default because it does not use prompt presets.
- **Connection** — optionally send impersonation calls to a different model, such as a cheaper or faster connection.
- **Quick replies** — to get a one-click impersonate button beside Send, enable **Settings -> Advanced -> Message Tools -> Quick replies** and include the Impersonate action.
- **Use CYOA as direction** — clicking a CYOA option feeds it to impersonation as guidance instead of sending it as a normal user message.
- **Skip agents** — when enabled, skips agents during impersonation so drafting stays fast and does not mutate trackers or world state.

For per-chat prompt tuning, use `/impersonate_prompt "your prompt"` or `/impersonate_prompt reset`.

## Conversation profiles: display name, about me, and behavior

Conversation Mode gives every participant — characters **and** your persona — a lightweight, Discord-style profile: a **display name**, an **about me**, and (for characters) a **behavior directive** that only applies here. These fields live on the character card (under a **Convo** tab) and in the persona editor, and they are **strictly Conversation-only**: they are never read, sent, or resolved in Roleplay, Visual Novel, or Game mode, even when the same card is used there.

### Convo display name

An optional name shown as the sender label above a character's (or your persona's) messages in Conversation, in place of the card/persona name. Leave it blank to fall back to the card name.

- Set it in the character card's **Convo** tab (**Convo Display Name**) or in the **Persona editor**.
- It updates live — renaming reflects on existing messages in the chat.
- The `{{convo_display}}` macro resolves to the responding character's convo display name (empty outside Conversation).
- **Declare this name on the card in the prompt** (character-only toggle): when on, the character's card is prefixed with a line like `Conversation display name: Pancake`, so the model can map the name it sees in chat to that specific card. Handy in group chats where display names diverge from card names.

Clicking a participant's **avatar or name** opens their profile popout (below).

### About me

A short, self-authored bio — a couple of lines, an inside joke, a single emoji, or nothing at all. There are two layers:

- **Default (public)** — lives on the character card (**About Me** on the Convo tab) or on the persona. It's the cross-chat default and, being public, everyone in a chat can see it.
- **Chat-specific override** — set from within one chat; applies only to that chat and **takes precedence** over the default there.

**Viewing and editing:** click a participant's avatar or name in Conversation to open a Discord-style **profile popout** — blown-up avatar, presence, and their effective about me. From there:

- **Edit** sets a **chat-specific override** for this chat (with an emoji picker; `:custom_emoji:` works too).
- **Clear** removes the override and reverts to the public default.
- **Revert** (while editing) undoes your changes back to what the field held when you opened the editor.

The default about me is edited on the card/persona; the popout only changes the per-chat override.

**In the prompt:** about mes are auto-injected for all present participants each turn, as a short "participant profiles" block, with a per-chat off-switch in chat settings if you'd rather place them yourself. The macros `{{char_about}}` (responding character) and `{{persona_about}}` (your persona) drop them exactly where you want in a custom prompt (both empty outside Conversation).

### AI Write (and where it draws from)

Both the card editor and the in-chat popout have an **AI Write** button that drafts an in-character about me. It's deliberately allowed to come back sparse, joking, or empty — it won't force a tidy, earnest bio, and it won't silently overwrite existing text with a blank result.

A **⚙️** beside AI Write picks which sources the draft draws on (defaults to **Personality** only):

- Card fields — **Description, Personality, Scenario, Backstory, Appearance**
- **Convo behavior** directive
- **Lorebook entries** — the character's lorebook entries. In the **card editor**, turning this on expands to a checkbox list so you can pick exactly which entries feed the bio (useful when a card leaves its fields blank and keeps everything in the lorebook). The in-chat popout points you back to the card editor to make that selection.
- **Chat context** — recent messages from this chat, with a message-limit. Only available in the in-chat editor (a chat-specific about me), since the card editor has no chat to read.

Different creators build cards differently — some leave the card fields empty and live entirely in a lorebook — so the source list is per-character and saved on the card.

### Convo behavior

A Conversation-only instruction for how a character behaves in chat (e.g. "keep replies short and lowercase; text like a real person, not a narrator"), plus a **placement** control for where it lands in the prompt:

- **Constant — before / after the card**
- **Append to / Prepend to / Replace post-history**
- **Only where `{{convo_behavior}}` is placed** — for full manual control in a custom prompt

Set it on the character card's Convo tab. Like the other profile fields, it never reaches RP/VN/Game prompts.

### Characters that keep their own about me current

Two **opt-in**, Conversation-only ways for a character to update its own about me mid-conversation:

- **About Me Keeper agent** — an opt-in post-processing agent (configurable cadence) that lets a character refresh its about me over time. It can update either its **public** profile (routed through the normal character-card approval modal, so you review it first) or a **chat-specific** override (applied automatically to that chat). The prompt keeps the public/private distinction explicit and the results authentic. Enable it in the chat's agent settings.
- **`update_about_me` command** — an opt-in function-call tool (**Chat Settings -> Commands -> Function Calling**) a character can call in-character to update its own about me mid-turn, choosing `public` or `chat` scope. Off by default.

Both are the character speaking for itself, so they only ever touch the acting character's own about me — a character can't rewrite someone else's.

### Theming the profile popout

The popout is fully CSS-themable from a character's or persona's **Creator Notes** via `mari-about-me-*` hooks. See the [Card CSS Theming Guide -> About Me Profile Popout](card-css-theming-guide.md#about-me-profile-popout-conversation-only).

## Conversation-specific features

These are features Conversation Mode has that other modes don't.

### Character schedules

Each character in a Conversation chat has a **7-day × 24-hour availability grid** showing their status (`online`, `idle`, `dnd`, `offline`) and a per-hour activity description (e.g. `Meetings`, `Free time`, `Sleeping`). The grids are:

- **Auto-generated** when enabled during setup or from chat settings. The schedule generator reads each character's card and infers a reasonable weekly pattern using the chat's connection.
- **User-editable** in the chat settings drawer — open the schedule editor, drag-fill cells, type custom activity strings.
- **Regenerable** with global guidance preferences (e.g. `no characters past midnight`, `everyone is a college student`).

Schedules add **routine-aware autonomous messaging timing**. When schedules are enabled, a character whose schedule says they're `offline` won't reach out unprompted, even if autonomous messages are enabled. When schedules are off or missing, autonomous messages still work from the character's talkativeness and your active/idle/DND status, without routine availability or busy-delay behavior. Schedules are stored per-chat, so the same character can have different routines in different conversations.

### Autonomous messages

A toggle in the chat settings drawer and setup wizard. When enabled, characters can send you messages **on their own** if you've been idle for a while. The autonomous messaging service reads each character's personality and schedule, then triggers an unprompted message when:

- The user has been inactive for a configured amount of time.
- The character is available according to their schedule, if schedules are enabled.
- The character's personality fits reaching out (a chatty character will message sooner than a reserved one).

Schedules are optional. Without schedules, chatty characters can still reach out based on talkativeness and whether your status is active or idle. If your status is DND, Marinara suppresses autonomous messages.

Autonomous messages **default to ON** when you complete the setup wizard. Turn them off in the chat settings drawer if you want messages only when you initiate.

### Reactions

Conversation messages support emoji reactions. Use the per-message reaction button to add your own reaction. The note `[User reacted with ...]` becomes visible to future prompts so characters can notice it.

If the **Reactions** command is enabled in the Commands grid, characters can react to your messages or each other's messages. Character-to-character reactions use the command form:

```text
[react: emoji="💙" to "Character Name"]
```

Reactions are especially useful in group chats because they let a character respond lightly without sending a full message.

### Table games: UNO and Chess

Conversation Mode can host built-in table games. Enable **UNO** and/or **Chess** in the Commands grid during setup or under **Chat Settings -> Commands**.

- **UNO** lets characters start a table game when you agree to play, with bot/model turns and board state.
- **Chess** lets a character accept a one-on-one chess challenge, with move validation and a board UI.

These games are Conversation-only social features; they do not require Game Mode.

### Audio/video calls

Conversation Mode supports audio-first calls with characters. Calls use a Discord-style call screen, a separate call-only chat, TTS playback for characters with voices, microphone transcription for your speech, incoming character-call accept/decline controls, and a post-call summary injected back into the normal conversation.

To enable calls for a chat:

1. Open **Chat Settings -> Commands**.
2. Open **Conversation Calls**.
3. Enable **Audio/Video Calls** to show the phone button for you.
4. Enable **Call Audio Pipeline** if you want Marinara to listen while your mic is unmuted.
5. Choose an **Audio input mode**.

Use **Connections -> Text to Speech** to configure the voice provider and character voices. Use **Connections -> Local Model -> Local Speech Model -> Download Whisper** if you want local microphone transcription, especially on Firefox or other browsers where browser speech recognition is unavailable.

The **Calls** command toggle is separate from the phone button. If the Calls command is enabled, characters may ring you and you can accept or decline. If it is disabled, you can still call them yourself when Audio/Video Calls are enabled.

See [Conversation Audio Calls](CONVERSATION_CALLS.md) for the full setup guide, audio input modes, Local Whisper notes, and troubleshooting.

### Selfies and per-character image generation

Conversation Mode supports characters sending you **selfies** — image-generation calls that produce photos of the character in context. Distinct from the world-and-scene illustrations Roleplay and Game Mode use, selfies are tied to one specific character.

To enable:

1. In the chat settings drawer, set a **Selfie Connection** (an image-generation provider — Stability AI, ComfyUI, AUTOMATIC1111, etc.).
2. Optionally set a **Resolution** (default `896x1152`).
3. Optionally set **Prompt Model**, **Image Style**, **Send Avatar References**, and **Attach Card Appearance**.

Once configured, characters can send selfies as part of their messages, or you can ask them for one explicitly. Each selfie costs an image-generation API call. If a selfie misses the character's appearance, enable **Attach Card Appearance**, enable **Send Avatar References** when your provider supports references, and check the character card's appearance fields.

## Connected chats

Conversations can be **connected** to a Roleplay or Game chat, letting your DM character know what's happening in the story. The bridge is intentionally **asymmetric**: Conversations auto-pull the connected story chat's recent messages every turn, while Roleplay/Game prompts do not automatically pull DM messages. Bridge from the DM back into the story manually with `<influence>` for one-shot guidance or `<note>` for durable guidance.

The full mechanics (when context flows automatically, how to bridge it manually with `<influence>` and `<note>` tags) are documented in the FAQ:

- [Why doesn't my roleplay character remember the messages from our connected conversation?](FAQ.md#why-doesnt-my-roleplay-character-remember-the-messages-from-our-connected-conversation)

## Recommended models

Conversation Mode is the most forgiving of the chat modes. Unlike Game Mode (which demands strict-JSON outputs that small models often fail), Conversation just needs the model to write coherent dialogue.

**Most modern API models work fine,** including:

- **Free-tier OpenRouter routing** — usable for lightweight Conversation chats when you explicitly configure it, in contrast to Game Mode where free or auto-routing models typically fail.
- **Mid-tier models** — Claude Haiku, GPT-4 mini, Gemini Flash, GLM5, Llama 3 70B, etc. Plenty of personality and dialogue quality.
- **Top-tier models** — Claude Opus/Sonnet, GPT-4 class, Gemini Pro. Better at long-context recall and consistent character voice over time, especially across long chat histories.

**When to upgrade your model:**

- The character keeps **breaking persona** or forgetting key facts — try a more capable model.
- You're running **long chats** (thousands of messages) and the character has lost the thread of older context — bigger context window helps.
- The character's prose feels **flat or repetitive** — better models tend to write more varied dialogue.

**Specific notes:**

- **Autonomous messages, schedules, and group replies** use the chat's own connection. Very weak models can fail these. If schedules generate as gibberish or autonomous messages misfire, switch the chat connection to a mid-tier or better model.
- **Group chats** put more pressure on the model to keep distinct character voices apart from each other. If you notice characters bleeding together — speaking the same way, finishing each other's sentences in unintended ways — switch to a more capable model on the chat connection.

## Lorebooks in Conversation

Lorebooks attached to a Conversation chat work the way they're typically used in chat frontends — both **constant** and **keyword-triggered** entries fire on each turn:

- **Constant entries** — always injected into the prompt, every turn. Use for setting facts that should always be in context (the world this chat takes place in, the relationships between characters, ground rules).
- **Keyword-triggered entries** — injected when the trigger words appear in recent chat messages. Use for content that should only show up when relevant (specific NPCs by name, location-specific details, items by name).

This is different from Game Mode's world-gen, where only constant entries fire (because there's no chat text yet to match against keywords). In Conversation, both kinds work normally.

The lorebook editor itself has its own in-app UI for authoring entries — keywords, position, recursion settings, folder organization. The depth of those settings is beyond this guide; the inline help in the editor covers them.

## Generation parameters

Conversation uses Marinara's shared generation parameter system. See [Generation Parameters](GENERATION_PARAMETERS.md) for the defaults table, tuning advice, and per-backend gotchas (Claude `temperature`/`topP` conflict, Claude thinking mode, OpenRouter caveats).

For Conversation specifically, the defaults work well as-is for most use cases. Two tuning hints if you want the chat to feel different:

- **Same character keeps repeating phrasing across many turns** — raise `frequencyPenalty` or `presencePenalty` slightly (`0.3`–`0.6`).
- **Character voice feels stiff** — raise `temperature` to `1.1` or `1.2`. Conversation tolerates more variability than Game Mode does because there's no JSON parsing risk.

## Troubleshooting

### How do I see what calls Conversation Mode is making?

Set `LOG_LEVEL=debug` in your `.env` file and restart the server. Marinara logs complete LLM prompts (every message role and content), full responses, token counts, and per-agent batch details. This is the most reliable way to see what context the model is receiving on each turn — including which lorebook entries fired, what the persona injected, and how big each prompt is.

Set it back to `warn` (the default) when you're done — debug output is high-volume. See [Logging Levels](CONFIGURATION.md#logging-levels) for full details.

**Privacy note before sharing logs:** debug output contains your full prompts — character cards, persona content, lorebook entries, and chat history. Redact private content (NSFW, real-world identifiers, anything you wouldn't want public) before posting logs in Discord, GitHub issues, or any public forum.

### Autonomous messages are spamming me

Open the chat settings drawer and turn off **Autonomous messages**. They default to ON when you complete the setup wizard, so this is a common adjustment. If the character is messaging more aggressively than you'd like, you can also reshape their schedule to mark more hours `dnd` or `offline`, which suppresses autonomous reach-outs during those windows.

### Group chat: one character monopolizes responses

Two options:

- Turn on **Reply When Mentioned** in the chat settings drawer and `@mention` characters explicitly when you want them to speak.
- Or use the **character picker** that appears in the input bar to trigger specific characters' responses one at a time without enabling Reply When Mentioned globally.

### Character forgets things from earlier in the conversation

Long chats fill the model's context window. The engine summarizes older messages, but compression loses fidelity. Things to try:

- Bump to a model with a larger context window.
- Add critical facts to a **lorebook entry as constant** so they're always in scope, regardless of how far back in chat history they were said.
- Open a fresh chat (with the same character / persona) when the current one gets very long. You can still reference past chats via connected chats if you want continuity.

### Selfies fail or generate the wrong character

Two common causes:

- The Selfie Connection isn't producing the character correctly — enable **Attach Card Appearance**, enable **Send Avatar References** if your provider supports image references, and check that the character card's appearance fields describe the character clearly.
- The image-gen provider returned an error — check the network tab in your browser dev tools or the server logs (`LOG_LEVEL=debug`) for the actual API response.
