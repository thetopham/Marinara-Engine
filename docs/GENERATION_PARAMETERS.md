# Generation Parameters

Marinara's chat modes (Conversation, Roleplay, Visual Novel, Game) all use a shared set of generation parameters per LLM connection. These control how the model samples responses — temperature, top-p, max output tokens, and so on — and live in each connection's settings under **Settings -> Connections -> edit a connection -> Default Chat Parameters**. Enable **Use custom defaults for this connection** before editing connection defaults.

This is the canonical reference. Mode-specific guides reference this doc rather than repeating the table.

## Defaults

Generation parameters are **layered**. The effective parameters for a chat at runtime come from (in order of increasing precedence):

1. **The preset attached to the chat.** New presets start from a shared baseline, `DEFAULT_GENERATION_PARAMS` in `packages/shared/src/constants/defaults.ts`.
2. **Mode-specific runtime defaults.** Some modes inject preferred defaults at request time:
   - **Scene chats** (forked Roleplay scenes) preset `maxTokens: 8192`, `reasoningEffort: "maximum"`, `verbosity: "high"` before user overrides apply.
   - **Game Mode** is special: regular game turns apply connection and chat parameters first, then force the structured-turn defaults on top for non-Gemma models: `temperature: 1`, `maxTokens: 16384`, `topP: 1`, `topK: 0`, `minP: 0`, both penalties at `0`, `reasoningEffort: "maximum"`, and `verbosity: null`. User overrides for those fields do not affect regular game turns. Local Gemma models keep user samplers but still get a `maxTokens` floor of `16384`. The initial world-gen setup call honors explicit reasoning effort and verbosity but also floors the output budget at `16384`.
3. **The connection's `defaultParameters`**, settable when editing a connection. Wins over the preset baseline for fields whose **Send** switch is on.
4. **Per-chat overrides**, settable in the chat's settings drawer or via the wizard's "Customize generation parameters" toggle. Highest precedence.

### Preset baseline (`DEFAULT_GENERATION_PARAMS`)

What every new preset starts from:

| Parameter          | Default  | Notes                                                                                                                                   |
| ------------------ | -------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `temperature`      | `1`      | Higher = more variety; lower = more deterministic. See Claude notes below.                                                              |
| `maxTokens`        | `4096`   | Cap on response length. Game Mode manages its own output budget: world-gen is floored at `16384`, and regular game turns force `16384`. |
| `topP`             | `1`      | See Claude notes below.                                                                                                                 |
| `topK`             | `0`      | Disabled; most providers ignore it anyway.                                                                                              |
| `minP`             | `0`      | Disabled.                                                                                                                               |
| `frequencyPenalty` | `0`      |                                                                                                                                         |
| `presencePenalty`  | `0`      |                                                                                                                                         |
| `reasoningEffort`  | `null`   | When set, used by reasoning-capable models (Claude with extended thinking, OpenAI o-series/GPT-5 family). `null` = provider default.    |
| `verbosity`        | `null`   | When set, used by GPT-5-family models. `null` = provider default.                                                                       |
| `assistantPrefill` | `""`     | Optional text to prefill into the assistant's response. Most users leave empty.                                                         |
| `customParameters` | `{}`     | Provider-specific overrides for parameters Marinara doesn't expose by default.                                                          |
| `maxContext`       | `128000` | Max context window in tokens. Connections typically override this with their actual model's context window.                             |

### Send Toggles

Every parameter row has a **Send** switch. If Send is off, that parameter is omitted from the provider request no matter what value appears in the editor.

Defaults differ by surface:

- Setup wizard **Customize Parameters** editors start with all Send switches on.
- Connection **Default Chat Parameters** and existing-chat **Advanced Parameters** start stricter: only Max Output Tokens and Reasoning Effort are sent by default.

When a provider says two parameters cannot be combined, turn off one parameter's Send toggle. Leaving a slider at its default value is not the same as omitting it.

### Wizard customization starting points

When you toggle **Customize Parameters** in the chat setup wizard, the editor prefills slightly different starting values depending on the mode (defined in `packages/client/src/components/ui/GenerationParametersEditor.tsx`):

- **`CHAT_PARAMETER_DEFAULTS`** (Conversation wizard): differs from the baseline by setting `reasoningEffort: "maximum"` and `verbosity: "high"`.
- **`ROLEPLAY_PARAMETER_DEFAULTS`** (Roleplay / Visual Novel / Game wizards): same as `CHAT_PARAMETER_DEFAULTS` except `maxTokens` is `8192` instead of `4096`, since these modes typically render richer narrative output.

These wizard defaults only matter if you actually enable the customization toggle — they prefill the editor. If you leave the toggle off, no per-chat override is saved and the connection's existing parameters apply.

## Tuning

Most users don't need to change these. If you do:

- **Output feels stilted or repetitive:** raise `temperature` slightly (e.g. `1.1` to `1.3`).
- **Output feels chaotic or off-task:** lower `temperature` (e.g. `0.7` to `0.9`).
- **Output gets cut off mid-sentence or mid-JSON:** raise `maxTokens`.
- **A character keeps repeating phrasing across turns:** raise `frequencyPenalty` or `presencePenalty` slightly (e.g. `0.3` to `0.6`).

For ongoing chat or roleplay turns, `temperature` somewhere in the `0.8`–`1.0` range tends to feel balanced — but this is rule of thumb, not a tested recommendation. Different models respond differently; what works on one connection may not transfer.

## Per-backend gotchas

- **Claude direct (Anthropic provider)** — Marinara's Anthropic provider doesn't include `top_p` in its requests at all, so the temperature/top_p conflict doesn't arise on this route. For **Opus 4.7+**, **Fable 5**, and **Mythos 5** models specifically, the provider also strips `temperature` and `top_k` from the request because those models reject sampling parameters entirely — the UI sliders exist but have no effect.

- **Claude via OpenRouter or an OpenAI-compatible endpoint** — the engine automatically omits `topP` for Sonnet/Opus 4.5-4.6 on Anthropic direct, OpenRouter, and OpenAI-compatible routes, and strips all sampler params for **Opus 4.7+**, **Fable 5**, and **Mythos 5**. The manual workaround applies mainly to Claude models the engine does not recognize, notably Claude Haiku 4.5 through OpenRouter or an OpenAI-compatible endpoint: turn off either `temperature` or `topP` with that parameter's Send toggle, save, and retry.

- **Claude thinking mode** — when extended thinking is enabled, the engine strips `temperature` from the request to satisfy Claude's constraint that sampler params can't combine with extended thinking. `presencePenalty` and `frequencyPenalty` aren't native Claude sampling parameters and don't typically have effect on Claude. Output behavior is shaped primarily by `reasoningEffort` and model choice; tuning samplers in this configuration may produce no observable change.

- **OpenAI GPT-5.6** — Marinara routes GPT-5.6 API models through the Responses API. `reasoningEffort: "maximum"` maps to OpenAI's `reasoning.effort: "max"` for GPT-5.6 Sol/Terra/Luna. Sampler controls such as temperature/top-p are stripped because GPT-5.6 rejects them. Selecting `gpt-5.6-sol-pro` uses `gpt-5.6-sol` with provider-native pro mode internally. The chat-level **Exclude Past Reasoning** toggle controls whether compatible prior reasoning is reused.

- **OpenRouter auto-routing** — sampler behavior depends on the underlying model your route resolves to. If you're using `openrouter/auto`, `openrouter/free`, or any other auto-routing model, your sampler settings may behave inconsistently between calls because the underlying model can change. Pinning a specific model keeps behavior predictable.
