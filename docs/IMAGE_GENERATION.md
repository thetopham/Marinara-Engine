# Image Generation

Marinara Engine centralizes image prompt style through **Settings -> Generations -> Image Generation -> Style Profiles**. A style profile controls how roleplay selfies, avatars, sprites, Game Mode backgrounds, NPC portraits, and scene illustrations are shaped before they are sent to the selected image provider.

## Style profiles

Built-in profiles cover common local Stable Diffusion workflows:

- **Auto** keeps prompts flexible and lets the current character, game, scene, and model imply the style.
- **Anime** uses general anime-style tags.
- **Danbooru / Illustrious** uses SDXL/Danbooru-style tags for checkpoints such as Illustrious, Pony, NovelAI-like, and related anime models.
- **Realistic SDXL** and **Photorealistic** favor natural-language realism and photo-oriented negative prompts.
- **Cinematic**, **Digital Painting**, and **Painterly Fantasy** add art-direction language for key-art and illustration workflows.
- **Z-Image Turbo Narrative** preserves compact narrative expression for Z-Image Turbo-style models that parse prose well.

Profiles are user-editable. Clone a built-in profile to define what "anime", "photorealistic", or any custom house style should mean for your own local install. Each profile can define:

- Prompt grammar: natural language, comma tags, Danbooru tags, or hybrid.
- Positive style text and tags.
- Negative tags.
- Per-image tags for avatars, portraits, selfies, backgrounds, illustrations, and sprites.

## Prompt cleanup

Before a request reaches the image provider, Marinara compiles the prompt with the selected style profile. The compiler:

- Removes near-duplicate tags such as repeated quality tags.
- Moves simple negative phrases like `avoid text` or `no watermark` into the negative prompt.
- Keeps user wording intact where possible, especially for natural-language and Z-Image Turbo profiles.
- Adds the profile's per-image tags so backgrounds, portraits, and illustrations can share one style without identical composition language.

Use the Style Profiles test bench to paste a messy sample prompt and see the final positive and negative prompts that Marinara would send.

## Connection defaults

Each local image connection can optionally choose a style profile in **Connections -> Local Image Defaults**. Leave it on **Use global default** to follow the global profile. Marinara also suggests a profile from common model/checkpoint names, but it does not switch profiles automatically.

Style profile precedence is: explicit chat/game/profile selection, then the image connection default, then the global default style profile.

The backend-specific controls for AUTOMATIC1111/Forge, ComfyUI, NovelAI, and other providers remain in the existing connection defaults. Style profiles only control prompt shape.

The chat-level Illustrator agent defaults to **Background** prompt mode for new or unconfigured selections. Choose **Illustration**, a comic/manga mode, or **Selfie** in the chat's Illustrator card when you want character-focused output instead. Explicit selections already saved on a chat continue to win.

### NovelAI multi-character storyboards

Game Mode storyboards use NovelAI's native multi-character prompting automatically with official V4 and V4.5 connections. The per-chat **Use NovelAI Character Prompts** setting defaults on. For keyframes with two or more named visible characters, the Storyboard Illustrator produces a shared base scene prompt plus up to six character-specific prompts. Marinara sends those prompts as NovelAI character captions with matching character-only negatives and approximate normalized positions. This helps keep identity, hair, clothing, expression, pose, and interaction roles from leaking between characters.

Character reference images remain separate and still follow **Chat Settings -> Agents -> Illustrator -> Send Avatar References**. If multiple Precise References cause blended identities in a group scene, turn that setting off and let the native character prompts carry identity and placement. Turn **Use NovelAI Character Prompts** off to restore the legacy combined prompt where all character tags remain in the shared scene prompt. NovelAI-compatible proxy endpoints continue using their normal combined-prompt behavior; structured character captions require the official NovelAI V4/V4.5 image endpoint.

Select the built-in **NovelAI Keyframes** storyboard prompt for compact ASCII Danbooru tags without `Scene moment`, `Narrative purpose`, or `Characters` prose inside `imagePrompt`. Enabling **Use Storyboard Prompt Directly** sends that tag list with global style tags and bypasses the Game Scene Illustration wrapper.

## Prompt review

When **Expose image prompts before sending** is enabled in **Settings -> Generations -> Image Generation**, Marinara shows the final compiled positive prompt and, when available, the final compiled negative prompt before generation. Editing either field changes exactly what is sent for that request; reviewed prompts are not compiled a second time after confirmation.

## Noodle post images

Noodle can generate images for model-authored social posts with its own image connection, daily limit, avatar-reference controls, character descriptions, and optional Gallery attachments. Its registered prompt override is **Noodle Post Image** (`noodle.imagePost`) under **Settings -> Generations -> Image Generation Prompt Overrides**. Noodle's local **Prompt instructions** setting is passed into that override before the result goes through the normal style-profile compiler.

See [Noodle](NOODLE.md#image-generation) for setup and the [Noodle prompt source map](NOODLE.md#prompt-source-map-for-maintainers) for the implementation entry points.

## Scene videos

Scene videos are configured separately from still-image generation. They use **Video Generation** connections, animate existing Gallery illustrations, and save MP4 files in their own media store. See [Scene Video Generation](SCENE_VIDEO_GENERATION.md) for setup, Gallery controls, provider defaults, and editable prompt templates.
