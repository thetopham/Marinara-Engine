# Troubleshooting Marinara Engine

This guide lists common problems in Marinara Engine and how to fix them. Find the section that matches your symptom, then follow the steps. If nothing here helps, see the last section, Getting more help.

## First things to try

Many problems clear up with two quick steps.

1. Do a hard refresh of the page. Press **Ctrl+Shift+R** on Windows or Linux, or **Cmd+Shift+R** on a Mac.
2. Look at the server console (the terminal window that runs Marinara) for red error lines. Those lines usually name the real problem.

If you are asking the team for help, turn on **Debug mode** first so the server logs the prompt and response. See Getting more help at the end of this guide.

## Install and launch problems

### Windows: EPERM or corepack signature error when installing pnpm

pnpm is the package manager Marinara uses to install its code. If you see `EPERM: operation not permitted` or a corepack signature verification failure, corepack could not write into the Node install folder.

Pick one fix:

1. Right-click your terminal, choose Run as administrator, then run the launcher again.
2. Install pnpm yourself. Run this command, then run the launcher again:

```bash
npm install -g pnpm
```

3. Update corepack in an administrator terminal, then run the launcher again:

```bash
npm install -g corepack
```

### Linux: ERR_PNPM_ENAMETOOLONG during install

This means an older install left behind long folder paths. From the Marinara folder, clear the partial install and run the launcher again:

```bash
rm -rf node_modules .pnpm .pnpm-store
```

Then start Marinara again with `./start.sh`. If you install by hand, run `pnpm install` after removing those folders.

### ERR_PNPM_TRUST_DOWNGRADE or a missing chess.js during build

This is almost always a half-finished install. First rerun the launcher so it can repair the workspace. If you install by hand, run this single command from the Marinara folder:

```bash
pnpm --config.trustPolicy=off --config.confirmModulesPurge=false install --frozen-lockfile
```

The `Cannot find module 'chess.js'` build error is the same problem. The package did not get linked during the aborted install, and a clean reinstall fixes it.

## Blank, stale, or old-looking screen

Sometimes the server is running but the browser shows a blank page, or the app looks like an old version after an update. In that case your browser is holding a cached copy of the web app.

1. Do a hard refresh (**Ctrl+Shift+R** or **Cmd+Shift+R**).
2. If that does not help, open **Settings**, go to the **Advanced** tab, then the **Updates** section, and click **Refresh App**.

**Refresh App** clears the browser service worker (a background script that caches the web app) and the browser cache, then reloads. It does not change your data. Your chats, settings, and other local data stay intact. It also does not update the server code, so it is not a substitute for a real update. See [Upgrading Marinara Engine](UPGRADING.md) to update the app itself.

## Accessing Marinara from another device

If you cannot access Marinara from a phone, tablet, or another computer on your network, work through these checks.

- Bind the server to a reachable address. The server listens on `127.0.0.1` (loopback, your own machine only) by default. The shell launchers set `HOST=0.0.0.0` for you. If you started with `pnpm start` by hand, set `HOST=0.0.0.0` in your `.env` file first.
- Confirm both devices are on the same Wi-Fi network.
- Confirm no firewall blocks the port. The default port is `7860`, or whatever you set as `PORT`.
- Set up access control. For ordinary network or public clients, set `BASIC_AUTH_USER` and `BASIC_AUTH_PASS` in `.env`. Loopback stays passwordless. Traffic over Tailscale and the Docker bridge is trusted by default.
- For privileged actions from that device (backups, data clearing, updates), set `ADMIN_SECRET` in the server `.env`. Then paste the same value into **Settings** > **Advanced** > **Admin Access** on that device and click **Save**.

For the full walkthrough, see [Remote Access](REMOTE_ACCESS.md) and the [Frequently Asked Questions](FAQ.md).

## Save blocked, or settings that do not persist

If a save seems to work but reverts when you reload, Marinara's cross-site protection is blocking it. CSRF (cross-site request forgery) protection guards actions that change data. It only trusts certain browser origins.

You will see one or both of these signs:

- A red banner at the top of the screen warning that saves will silently fail because this origin is not trusted.
- A toast titled **Save blocked: missing CSRF header**, **Save blocked: cross-site request rejected**, or **Save blocked: origin not trusted**.

Loopback, private network addresses, Tailscale, and the Docker bridge are trusted automatically. This usually only happens when you reach Marinara through a public IP address or a domain name. Add that address to `CSRF_TRUSTED_ORIGINS` in `.env`. Use a comma-separated list for more than one, for example:

```bash
CSRF_TRUSTED_ORIGINS=http://203.0.113.10:7831,https://chat.example.com
```

No restart is needed. The banner has a Copy button that fills in the exact line for you. See [Remote Access](REMOTE_ACCESS.md) for more.

## Connection and generation errors

Generation errors appear as a toast at the bottom of the screen. If a connection failed, the toast names the reason. The toast stays up long enough to read and copy.

- **No API connection configured for this chat**: the chat has no connection selected. Open the **Connections** panel, create one, then pick it for the chat. See [Connecting to an AI Provider](connections/connecting-to-a-provider.md). An API key is a secret code from a provider that lets Marinara use their models.
- The model does not accept a parameter: the toast tells you which one. Open **Chat Settings** > **Advanced Parameters** and find that parameter. Turn off the switch next to its name (the tooltip reads "This parameter is sent to the model").
- The model says a parameter is required: do the same, but turn the switch next to that parameter on.
- **The AI returned an empty response. Try sending your message again.**: send your message again. If it keeps happening, try a different model or connection.
- **A generation is already in progress for this chat**: one reply is still streaming. Wait for it to finish or click the Stop button, then try again.
- **No connections are marked for the random pool**: you turned on random connection routing but marked no connections for the pool. Add at least one connection to the pool, or turn random routing off.

## Local Model problems

The **Local Model** is an AI model that runs on your own machine with no API key. Some error messages use the word sidecar for this feature.

- If installing a runtime fails with **Sidecar runtime install is disabled**, the server has that action turned off for safety. On your own machine, set `SIDECAR_RUNTIME_INSTALL_ENABLED=true` in `.env`. From another device, paste your admin secret into **Settings** > **Advanced** > **Admin Access** first.
- If the model download or setup fails from another device (a network address or Docker), it may also need the admin secret. On your own machine, no admin secret is needed. See the point above for where to paste the secret.

For full setup, see [Local Model Setup](connections/local-model.md).

## Memory and summaries

### Memory Recall does not recall anything

**Memory Recall** searches earlier messages and quietly adds the most relevant ones back into the prompt. If it seems to remember nothing, check these.

1. Open **Chat Settings** > **Memory Recall** and confirm **Enable Memory Recall** is on.
2. Open **Access memories for this chat**. In the **Memories for This Chat** window, look at each chunk's status.
3. A status of **Waiting for vector** means the memory is still being processed. Wait, then chat again.
4. A status of **Embedding unavailable** means no embedding source is working. Configure an embedding connection, or let the built-in local model load. See [Local Model Setup](connections/local-model.md).

A memory needs at least 5 new messages before it is created. Recall also only shows memories that closely match your new message, so it can return nothing even when memories exist.

### Summaries are not generating

Chat summaries need a working text connection to write them.

- In Roleplay mode, open the **Chat Summary** popover and confirm a connection is set. Use **Backfill Summary** to catch up an older chat.
- In Conversation mode, open **Automatic Summarization** and use **Backfill** to retry days that failed.
- If your chat requires agent write approval, an AI summary waits for your review before it takes effect.
- A summary that keeps failing (for example, a bad API key) is retried on a delay. Fix the connection, then use **Backfill**.

## Bot Browser problems

The **Bot Browser** lets you search public character sites and import characters. Open it from the **Bot Browser** icon in the top bar.

- If JannyAI search or a character page fails with a Cloudflare block, Marinara shows a message. It asks you to visit the JannyAI site once in the same browser to clear the challenge, then retry.
- If your CharacterTavern or Pygmalion login stops working after you restart the server, that is expected. Those logins live only in server memory and clear on restart. Open the login window and paste your cookie or token again.

## Media generation problems

### Sprite background cleanup still leaves white panels

The built-in **Clean Backgrounds** tool is a simple matte remover. It struggles with disconnected white panels, shadows, or white clothing. For stronger cleanup, install the optional AI background remover:

```bash
pnpm backgroundremover:install
```

Then restart Marinara and click **Reapply Cleanup** in the sprite generation window. If the install fails:

- Confirm Python 3.9 to 3.11 is installed. Newer Python versions can force slow native builds.
- Rebuild the tool with `pnpm backgroundremover:reinstall`.
- To force the old built-in cleanup while you troubleshoot, set `SPRITE_BACKGROUND_REMOVAL_ENGINE=builtin` in `.env`.

### Game Mode storyboards or scene videos do not appear

Storyboards are a Game Mode feature. They turn a completed narration turn into keyframe images and optional clips.

- For a manual scene video, generate or upload a **Gallery** image first, then use its **Video** or **Animate** action. The **Gallery** splits **Images** and **Videos** into tabs, so check the **Videos** tab.
- For automatic storyboards, open **Chat Settings** > **Agents** > **Storyboards** and confirm **Automatic Storyboard Illustrations** is on. Turn on **Automatic Storyboard Animations** too if you also want clips.
- Keyframe images need a Game image connection. Clips also need a video connection.
- If a custom prompt works better with all characters combined, turn off **Use NovelAI Character Prompts**.
- Slow providers can hit a timeout. Raise `IMAGE_GEN_TIMEOUT_MS` or `VIDEO_GEN_TIMEOUT_MS` in `.env`, then restart Marinara. The server only reads these values at startup.

See [Game Mode: Getting Started](game/getting-started.md) for the full setup.

### Game Mode world generation shows a JSON error

If starting a game fails because the model returned broken JSON, Marinara opens the **Repair JSON** window instead of throwing the whole turn away. JSON is the structured text format the model must return.

1. Fix the brackets, commas, or fields in the editor. The banner reads **JSON is valid.** once the text parses.
2. Click **Format** to tidy the layout.
3. Click **Apply Repaired JSON** to use it without regenerating the whole response.

## Voice, calls, and TTS

- If characters do not speak during a call, Text to Speech is not set up. Open **Connections** > **Text to Speech**, enable it, choose a source, enter your key, pick a voice, and save. A character with no voice appears as text only.
- If the microphone is not working, you may need the local speech model. Open **Connections** > **Local Model**, expand the card, find **Local Speech Model**, choose a Whisper model, and click **Download Whisper**. Firefox in particular needs this because it lacks browser speech recognition.
- On a Lite build, the message **Local Whisper is disabled in Lite mode** means that small build cannot run the local speech model. Use a full Marinara install instead.

### Music DJ Spotify login fails on a remote or network install

The Music DJ agent's Spotify mode uses OAuth. OAuth is a login handoff where Spotify sends you back to a callback address. A redirect URI is that callback address, and Spotify only accepts `https://` addresses or the loopback address `http://127.0.0.1`. It rejects plain network IP addresses.

- If you reach Marinara at localhost, the editor shows a `127.0.0.1` callback. Register that with Spotify and the login completes.
- If you reach Marinara over HTTPS, the editor shows your HTTPS callback. Register that.
- If HTTPS is terminated upstream and the host does not match, set `SPOTIFY_REDIRECT_URI` in `.env` to your public callback address.
- On a plain-HTTP network install, the popup cannot load, but the address bar still holds a valid code. Copy the full URL from the popup. Then expand **Browser couldn't reach the callback?** under the Connect button and paste it. The pasted URL is valid for 10 minutes.

The cleanest long-term fix is to put the server behind HTTPS. Last checked against Marinara Engine 2.2.0. Spotify tightened these rules in February 2025.

## Storage and data

### Data seems missing after an update

If your chats or presets look missing after an update, do not delete any data folders yet. Marinara keeps your live data in a `storage` folder inside its data directory. Older installs may also have a legacy `marinara-engine.db` file that can still be imported.

Check both of these local locations for a `storage` folder or the legacy database file:

1. `packages/server/data/`
2. `data/`

The server prints the data directory it resolved on startup. On the first launch after upgrading, Marinara imports the old database automatically.

### Legacy database errors on startup

If you see database or migration errors after updating, remove any custom `STORAGE_BACKEND=sqlite` line from your `.env` and restart. The default file-based backend imports the old database once and then runs without migrations.

### Backup or Export returns 403

Loopback sessions can make backups without an admin secret. From another device, a network address, or Docker, backups and profile exports need more. Set `ADMIN_SECRET` on the server and save the same value in **Settings** > **Advanced** > **Admin Access**. If you want loopback to require the secret too, set `MARINARA_REQUIRE_ADMIN_SECRET_ON_LOOPBACK=true`.

## Android and Docker

### Android app stuck on Connecting or Waiting for Server

The Android app is a small shell around Termux. Termux is a Linux terminal app for Android, and it runs the real Marinara server.

1. Tap **Install / Start Marinara**.
2. If Android asks to install Termux, approve the prompts.
3. If Android asks to run commands in Termux, grant it.
4. Wait for the launcher to finish and start the server, then return to the app.

Also confirm the app and Termux use the same port. The default is `7860`. If you built the app with a different port, set the matching `PORT` in the Termux `.env` too.

### Android update stops with exit status 134

Exit status 134 usually means Android ran out of memory during a build step. Update again from the latest launcher:

```bash
./start-termux.sh
```

If it still stops, close other Android apps, reopen Termux, and run the command again.

### Android update runs out of storage while installing dependencies

The built Marinara app is not several gigabytes, and Noodle does not download its own AI models. A large temporary footprint during an update usually comes from pnpm's dependency store and virtual store, especially after several releases or an interrupted forced reinstall.

The current launcher prunes packages left over from older releases and avoids rebuilding the dependency store more than once for the same update. If an older launcher already filled the device, update the launcher and reclaim its unreferenced cache before trying again:

```bash
cd Marinara-Engine
git pull --ff-only
pnpm store prune
./start-termux.sh
```

Do not delete `data`, `storage`, or `marinara-engine.db`; those locations may contain your chats and settings. If the command still stops, capture the lines beginning at `Installing dependencies` and include the phone's free-space and memory figures in the report.

### Container permission denied on a volume mount

If a Docker or Podman container fails with permission errors on the data volume:

- For named volumes after an update, pull the latest image and restart with `docker compose pull && docker compose up -d`. The official image repairs ownership on startup.
- For bind mounts, make the host folder writable by user and group ID `1000`, or use a named volume instead.
- On SELinux systems such as Fedora or RHEL, add the `:Z` suffix to the volume mount.

### Lite container crashes on a Raspberry Pi 4

If the lite container restarts whenever it sends an AI request on a Raspberry Pi 4 or similar ARM device, check the exit code. Exit 132 or SIGILL points to a known upstream problem in the lite image's Node build on some ARM chips. SIGILL means the program hit an instruction the CPU cannot run.

The regular (non-lite) image is not affected. Until the upstream fix ships, use the regular image on that device. Known affected lite images include `1.5.7-lite` and `1.5.8-lite`. Last checked against Marinara Engine 2.2.0.

## Getting more help

If you still need help, gather good detail first.

1. Open **Settings** > **Advanced** > **Message Tools** and turn on **Debug mode**. This logs the prompt and response payloads to the server console so you can share them.
2. Note your operating system, your Node.js version, and the full error text from the server console.

Before sharing debug output, remove API keys, access tokens, admin secrets, private prompts, and private chat content.
