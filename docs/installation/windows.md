# Windows Installation Guide

## Method 1: Windows Installer (Recommended)

Download the latest Installer from the [Releases](https://github.com/Pasta-Devs/Marinara-Engine/releases) page and run it.

The installer lets you choose the install folder, checks for Node.js and Git, aligns pnpm to the repo-pinned version even if an older global pnpm is already installed, clones the repo, installs dependencies, builds the app, and creates desktop and Start Menu shortcuts with the Marinara icon.

The installer creates a git-based checkout, so it auto-updates the same way as a manual clone when launched through the Start Menu shortcut or `start.bat`.

## Method 2: Run from Source

### Prerequisites

You need **Node.js** and **Git** installed.

**Install Node.js v24 LTS+:**

Download the installer from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/en/download) and run it.

**Install Git:**

Download from [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/download/win) and run the installer.

Verify both are installed:

```bat
node -v        :: should show v24 or higher
git --version  :: should show git version 2.x+
```

### Quick Start (Launcher)

```bat
git clone https://github.com/Pasta-Devs/Marinara-Engine.git
cd Marinara-Engine
start.bat
```

`start.bat` handles the rest: it aligns pnpm to the repo-pinned version, installs dependencies, builds the app, prepares local file-backed storage, and opens the app in your browser.

### Manual Setup

If you prefer to run commands yourself without the launcher:

```bat
git clone https://github.com/Pasta-Devs/Marinara-Engine.git
cd Marinara-Engine
pnpm install
pnpm build
pnpm start
```

Then open **<http://127.0.0.1:7860>**. Everything runs locally.

> `pnpm start` binds to `127.0.0.1` by default. To allow LAN access, set `HOST=0.0.0.0` in `.env` first.

## Optional AI Sprite Background Removal

Marinara can use the open-source [`backgroundremover`](https://github.com/nadermx/backgroundremover) Python tool for stronger transparent sprite cleanup. This is optional because it installs PyTorch and downloads U2Net models.

Install Python 3.11 from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/) first, then run this from the Marinara folder:

```bat
pnpm backgroundremover:install
```

The installer creates a local Python venv under `DATA_DIR\background-remover` and Marinara will use it automatically for sprite cleanup. To let `start.bat` install it automatically on first launch, set this in `.env`:

```env
BACKGROUNDREMOVER_AUTO_INSTALL=true
```

## Accessing from Another Device

## Updating

### Automatic (Launcher / Installer)

When you launch Marinara Engine via the Start Menu shortcut or `start.bat` from a git checkout, the launcher automatically:

1. Fetches the latest code from GitHub into `origin/main`, then fast-forwards normal clones or moves installer-created release checkouts to that commit
2. Detects whether the checkout changed
3. Temporarily stashes tracked local changes if needed, then reapplies them
4. Reinstalls dependencies and rebuilds when needed
5. Starts the app on the current version

This applies to both manual clones and installs created by the Windows installer.

### In-App Update Check

Go to **Settings → Advanced → Updates** and click **Check for Updates** to see whether a new release exists. The in-app **Apply Update** button is disabled by default; to enable it, set `UPDATES_APPLY_ENABLED=true`, set `ADMIN_SECRET`, and save that same secret in **Settings → Advanced → Admin Access**. Otherwise, relaunch Marinara Engine from the shortcut or `start.bat` to let the launcher update the app.

If you open Settings from an iPhone or iPad connected to this host, **Apply Update** still updates this Windows server. Remote apply also requires `UPDATES_ALLOW_REMOTE_APPLY=true`; otherwise, relaunch from the Start Menu shortcut or `start.bat` on Windows.

### Manual Update

If you use a git checkout without the launcher or the in-app updater:

```bat
git fetch origin +refs/heads/main:refs/remotes/origin/main
git merge --ff-only origin/main || git checkout --detach origin/main
pnpm install
pnpm build
```

Then restart the server.
